A simple python game made in 4 days.


Tips:  
Pressing the first letter also works eg: Fight can be just F  
Healing and Lifesteal scales with Max HP  
Crits stack on top of each other eg: 1 damage with 100% crit damage does 2 damage with 1 crit, 4 with 2 crits, and 8 with 3 crits  
The chances to get a weapon modifier increases with weapon rarity  
The names of weapons do not mean anything, the rarity increases the chances of higher stats massively.

Weapon Modifiers:  
Lifesteal: Heals HP when attacking, scales with Max HP  
Health Bonus: Increases Max HP each round  
Heal Boost: Increases the chances of healing more  
Weapon Luck: Increases the chances of finding a weapon  
Chaos: Randomly modifies one stat of a weapon (equal chance to increase or decrease)

Known Issues:  
None
